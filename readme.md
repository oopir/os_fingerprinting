# Machine Learning Model for Passive OS Fingerprinting
OS fingerprinting is the process of detecting a remote server's OS by communicating with the server and analyzing its response. <br/> 
This process is used by security experts (and attackers), since knowing a server's OS reveals the server's security vulnerabilities. <br/><br/>
The most common  tools for fingerprinting (Nmap, NetworkMiner, Satori, p0f) rely on a database of "network signatures".<br/>
The database is maintained manually by security experts, and has not been updated in a long time (most tools rely on the database of p0f).<br/><br/>
In this project I attempt to create an ML model for OS fingerprinting. <br/>
I'll go over my process in the following sections.
